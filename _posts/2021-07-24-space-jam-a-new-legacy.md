# Review

_This review may contain spoilers._

It was fun.

But also too grownup. I get WB wants to always remind us what IP (intellectual property) they own. First LEGO Dimensions, then LEGO Batman and Ready Player One not Space Jam. But you got pick more age appropriate stuff. I am fine with Game of Thrones Ice zombie in the far background. But when it‚Äôs right behind Don  Cheadle for most of the game. Or having Wile Coyote do ‚ÄúWitness me!‚Äù in Mad Max: Fury Road and blow up the car with the real explosion it‚Äôs hard to explain to kids.

My oldest daughter liked it. My youngest wanted to leave the theater 4 times.
