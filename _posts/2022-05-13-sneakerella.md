# Review

Sneakerella is a fun and heartwarming film that puts a fresh spin on the classic Cinderella story. The cast is great, the music is catchy, and the dancing is top-notch. My kids also loved it, and they've been begging me to take them to see it again.

Here are some of the things I liked about Sneakerella:

- The cast is great. Chosen Jacobs is charming as El, Lexi Underwood is a scene-stealer as Kira King, and John Salley is hilarious as Darius King.
- The music is catchy. The songs are original and upbeat, and they'll have you singing along in no time.
- The dancing is top-notch. The cast is full of talented dancers, and they put on a show-stopping performance.
- The story is heartwarming. Sneakerella is a classic Cinderella story with a modern twist. It's a story about following your dreams and never giving up on what you want.

If you're looking for a fun and heartwarming film to watch with your family, I highly recommend Sneakerella. It's a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon or evening.
