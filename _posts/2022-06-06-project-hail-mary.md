# Review

Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir is a science fiction novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The story follows Ryland Grace, a botanist and mechanical engineer who wakes up alone on a spaceship light-years from Earth. With no memory of how he got there or what his mission is, Grace must use his scientific knowledge and ingenuity to save the human race from extinction.

What I loved most about this book was the way Weir was able to make the science feel so real. He did an excellent job of explaining complex scientific concepts in a way that was easy to understand, and he never lost sight of the human element of the story. Grace is a relatable and likable character, and I found myself rooting for him every step of the way.

I also appreciated the way Weir explored the themes of friendship, hope, and perseverance in this book. Project Hail Mary is a story about the power of the human spirit, and it will leave you feeling inspired and hopeful.

If you're a fan of science fiction, I highly recommend Project Hail Mary. It's an exciting, thought-provoking, and ultimately heartwarming novel that will stay with you long after you finish reading it.

Here are some of the things I liked about the book:
- The science is accurate and well-explained.
- The characters are relatable and likable.
- The story is exciting and suspenseful.
- The themes of friendship, hope, and perseverance are well-explored.

Here are some of the things I didn't like about the book:
- The ending is a bit rushed.
- Some of the science is a bit too complex for some readers.

Overall, I really enjoyed Project Hail Mary. It's a well-written, exciting, and thought-provoking science fiction novel that I would definitely recommend to others.
