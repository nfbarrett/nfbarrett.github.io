# Review

Tetris was an interesting story. The game is objectively one of the greatest of all time. Learning the story behind it coming to the Game Boy that I played almost 30 years ago is something I didn't know I wanted to know. Now I know parts are dramatized and made to make the story more enjoyable. I don't know if this was a good thing or a bad thing but while watching the film I wanted to google the real life people to learn more about them. Don't know if that took me out of the movie or I felt more interested.
